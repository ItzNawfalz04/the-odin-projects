    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Teh Tarik (literally "pulled tea") is a popular hot milk tea beverage in Southeast Asia.
    </p>
    <p>
        Its name is derived from the pouring process of "pulling" the drink during preparation. This creates a thick, frothy top and cools the tea down.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp black tea dust or loose tea leaves</li>
        <li>500ml boiling water</li>
        <li>4 tbsp sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>2 tbsp evaporated milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Steep the black tea in boiling water for 3-5 minutes, then strain out the leaves.</li>
        <li>Add the condensed milk and evaporated milk to the hot tea. Stir well.</li>
        <li>Prepare two large mugs. Pour the tea from one mug to the other from a height ("pulling") repeatedly.</li>
        <li>Continue pulling until the tea is frothy and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately in a glass mug.</li>
    </ol>
